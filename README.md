# raft-demo

This repository organizes some demo applications using [hashicorp's Go implementation](https://github.com/hashicorp/raft) of the [Raft Consensus Algorithm](https://raft.github.io).

## Applications

* **chatRoom**
	
	A naieve implementation of a chat room service following publish-subscriber pattern. On every chat message received, broadcasts it to every client connected.
	
	- Client execution is configured by a .toml file, and store received messages on a queue to discard equal messages sent by other replica.

	- Channels implementation based from [drewolson's gist chat.go](https://gist.github.com/drewolson/3950226).

* **kvstore**
	
	A key-value in-memory SM-Replicated storage server. Applies received "get", "set" and "delete" operations on a regular map, using Raft to ensure total order.

* **webkvstore**
	
	[Otoolep's](https://github.com/otoolep/hraftd) reference example of hashicorp raft, intially logging committed messages using Journey.

* **logger**

	A logger process that acts as a non-Voter replica on the raft cluster, only logging committed commands to it's own log file using Journey¹.

	¹Journey: an optimized logging package for log-recovery, work in progress.

* **diskstorage**
	
	A persistent storage application. Applies received "get", "set" and "delete" operations on a regular file following a calculated offset, simply defined by (key * storeValueOffset). Uses the same logic from **kvstore** application, except it's storage and FSM implementation.

* **recovery**

	TODO

## Usage

**chatRoom, kvstore and diskstorage** 

1. Set the number of replicas, their corresponding IP's and a port to listen for cluster UDP repplies on a .toml config file

	```toml
	rep=3
	svrIps=["127.0.0.1:11000", "127.0.0.1:11001", "127.0.0.1:11002"]
	udpport=15000
	```

2. Build and run the first server, passing a corresponding address to handle new join requests to the cluster. If no "-port" and "-raft" are set, ":11000" and ":12000" are assumed.

	```bash
	go build
	./server -id node0 -hjoin :13000
	```

3. Build and run the other replicas, configuring different address to listen for clients' requests and another to comunicate with the raft cluster. Also, don't forget to join the first replicated on the defined addr.
	
	```bash
	go build
	./server -id node1 -port :11001 -raft :12001 -join :13000
	./server -id node2 -port :11002 -raft :12002 -join :13000
	```

4. If needed, run the logger processes to record new entries to the Raft FMS on a txt file.
	
	```bash
	go build
	./logger -id log1 -raft :12003 -join :13000
	./logger -id log2 -raft :12004 -join :13000
	```

5. Now execute any number of clients and send desirable requisitions to the cluster.

	```bash
	go build
	./client -config=../client-config.toml
	```

**OBS:** 

- Kvstore application can interpret the [Protocol Buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/) message format specified at journey/pb.Message, or the ad-hoc format described bellow:

	```bash
	get-[key]
	set-[key]-[value]
	delete-[key]
	```

- A single Logger processes can connect to multiple Raft clusters. Simply pass unique value tuples as command line arguments:

	```bash
	./logger -id 'log0,log1' -raft ':12000,:12001' -join ':13000,:13001'
	```

## Profiling

**kvstore** and **diskstorage** applications supports both CPU and memory profiling from [pprof](https://golang.org/pkg/runtime/pprof/) library. To record some performance metrics, you just need to run the server programm passing the flags:

```bash
./server -cpuprofile=filename.prof -memprofile=filename.prof
```

In case you want to measure the efficiency of the decoupled logger process against application level logging, you can force both **kvstore** and **diskstorage** applications to synchronously save each new requisition into a log, by passing the flag:

```bash
./server -logfolder=/path/to/folder/
```

## Issues and Upcoming Features

* **[DONE]** Starting from [latest commmit](https://github.com/Lz-Gustavo/raft-demo/commit/f5d60037a364a8029bed4e3e84327b62a215ec45), project building is temporarily unavaiable due to Journey package dependency.

* **[DONE]** [Protocol Buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/) are going to be implemented for a faster serialize/deserialization of commands by **kvstore** application.

* **[ISSUE]** Eliminate bad dependency copying of **kvstore** by the **diskstorage** application.
